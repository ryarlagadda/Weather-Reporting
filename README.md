# Weather-Reporting
NodeJS Application
Weather Reporting is a NodeJS application.

Which reports the current temperature at a particular location when a location is provided.
In case if there is no location provided by the user based on the IP address it locates the user and reports back the current temperature.

Here I used the "ipinfo.io" API to get the current temperature based on the location
