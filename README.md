# Weather-Reporting
Weather Reporting is a NodeJS application.

Here I integrated 2 API's into the application to report current weather at a desired location.

This application provides current temperature at the user's location based on his IP address.

It even provides the temperature at a different location with location being passed by the user explicitly

***I used the "ipinfo.io" API to get the current location of the user by a ping to the server***

***I used "openweathermap.org" API to get the current weather based on user's location***
